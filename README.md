**BuildWatt: Predicting Building Energy Loads with Linear Regression**

BuildWatt is a machine learning project that uses Linear Regression to predict a building’s heating and cooling energy demands based on its architectural design features. By leveraging the UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset, this project demonstrates how data-driven modeling can support sustainable and energy-efficient building design.

_**Project Goals**_

Predict Heating Load (Y1) and Cooling Load (Y2) using 8 architectural features.

Analyze how design elements like relative compactness, surface area, glazing, and orientation impact energy efficiency.

Evaluate model performance and explore enhancements like regularization and cross-validation.

_**Features Used**_

Relative Compactness

Surface Area

Wall Area

Roof Area

Overall Height

Orientation

Glazing Area

Glazing Area Distribution

_**Techniques Applied**_

Linear Regression

Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Correlation Analysis

Train/Test Split

R² Score and MSE Evaluation

Ridge and Lasso Regularization

_**Dataset**_

The project uses the publicly available Energy Efficiency Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
